Face Recognition: Matching and verification.
Integration with E-Fine System: Database update and fine issuance.
Testing and Validation: Accuracy measures and reliability testing.
Deployment and Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates.
Challenges and Solutions:
Inaccuracies: Regular updates using AI and machine learning.

Privacy and Ethical Concerns: No third-party involvement; process under government authority.

Cost: Explore funding opportunities and conduct cost-benefit analysis.
Legal Framework: Work with lawmakers to develop regulations addressing privacy concerns.

Impact and Benefits:
Enhanced crime detection and increased efficiency for law enforcement.
Improved public safety and deterrence of criminal activity.
Integration with other technologies for comprehensive monitoring.
